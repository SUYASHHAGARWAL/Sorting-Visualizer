# 📦 Sorting Visualizer 🎨📊  

## 📌 Introduction  

Sorting algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science, used to arrange data in a particular order (ascending or descending). However, for many learners, understanding how these algorithms work behind the scenes can be challenging by just reading code or theory.  

This **Sorting Visualizer** project was created to help users learn and understand various sorting techniques through dynamic and interactive visual demonstrations. It provides a clear, step-by-step graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms manipulate an array of numbers to sort them.

## 📈 How It Works  

The project generates a random array of numbers and represents each number as a vertical bar. Each sorting algorithm operates on this array, and with every comparison and swap, the changes are reflected visually by animating the heights and colors of the bars.  

Different colors are used to indicate:
- Elements being compared  
- Elements being swapped  
- Sorted portions of the array  

This visual feedback makes it easier for learners to grasp the inner workings of each algorithm and how it progresses toward sorting the entire array.
